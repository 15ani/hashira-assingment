# Hashira Placements Polynomial Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for the Hashira Placements polynomial roots assignment.

Given polynomial roots in different numeral bases, the program converts these roots into decimal values. The number of roots and minimum roots required to solve the polynomial coefficients are extracted from the input. The output provides decimal representations used for polynomial coefficient calculations.

## Files

- `PolynomialAssignment.java`  
  Java source code that parses input, converts roots from various bases to decimal, and prints the results.

- `output.txt`  
  Sample output of the program showing decimal root values for the provided test case.

## How to Run

1. Compile the Java file:
2. Run the program:
3. Check console output for converted root values.

## Notes

- The polynomial degree \( m \) and minimum roots required \( k \) are extracted as specified:  
\( k = m + 1 \)

- The output decimal roots are used to form linear equations for solving polynomial coefficients manually or with additional tools.

## Submission

This repository is submitted as part of the Hashira Placements online coding assignment.
